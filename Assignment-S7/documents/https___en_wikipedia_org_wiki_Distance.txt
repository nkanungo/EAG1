Distance
 is a numerical or occasionally qualitative 
measurement
 of how far apart objects, points, people, or ideas are. In 
physics
 or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical 
length
 or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. "two counties over").  The term is also frequently used metaphorically
[
1
]
 to mean a measurement of the amount of difference between two similar objects (such as 
statistical distance
 between 
probability distributions
 or 
edit distance
 between 
strings of text
) or a degree of separation (as exemplified by 
distance
 between people in a 
social network
).  Most such notions of distance, both physical and metaphorical, are formalized in 
mathematics
 using the notion of a 
metric space
.

In the 
social sciences
, 
distance
 can refer to a qualitative measurement of separation, such as 
social distance
 or 
psychological distance
.





Distances in physics and geometry

The distance between physical locations can be defined in different ways in different contexts.



Straight-line or Euclidean distance
[

Main article: 
Euclidean distance


The distance between two points in physical 
space
 is the 
length
 of a 
straight line
 between them, which is the shortest possible path.  This is the usual meaning of distance in 
classical physics
, including 
Newtonian mechanics
. 

Straight-line distance is formalized mathematically as the 
Euclidean distance
 in 
two-
 and 
three-dimensional space
.  In 
Euclidean geometry
, the distance between two points 
A
 and 
B
 is often denoted

A


B




|








{\displaystyle |AB|}




.  In 
coordinate geometry
, Euclidean distance is computed using the 
Pythagorean theorem
. The distance between points 
(

 and 
(

Measurement
[
edit
]


Main article: 
Distance measurement


There are many ways of 
measuring
 straight-line distances. For example, it can be done directly using a 
ruler
, or indirectly with a 
radar
 (for long distances) or 
interferometry
 (for very short distances).  The 
cosmic distance ladder
 is a set of ways of measuring extremely long distances.



Shortest-path distance on a curved surface
[
edit
]


Airline routes between 
Los Angeles
 and 
Tokyo
 approximately follow a 
great circle
 going west (top) but use the 
jet stream
 (bottom) when heading eastwards. The shortest route appears as a curve rather than a straight line because the 
map projection
 does not scale all distances equally compared to the real spherical surface of the Earth.


Main articles: 
Geographic distance
 and 
geodesic


The straight-line distance between two points on the surface of the Earth is not very useful for most purposes, since we cannot tunnel straight through the 
Earth's mantle
.  Instead, one typically measures the shortest path along the 
surface of the Earth
, 
as the crow flies
.  This is approximated mathematically by the 
great-circle distance
 on a sphere.

More generally, the shortest path between two points along a 
curved surface
 is known as a 
geodesic
.  The 
arc length
 of geodesics gives a way of measuring distance from the perspective of an 
ant
 or other flightless creature living on that surface.



Effects of relativity
[
edit
]


Main article: 
Distance measure


In the 
theory of relativity
, because of phenomena such as 
length contraction
 and the 
relativity of simultaneity
, distances between objects depend on a choice of 
inertial frame of reference
.  On galactic and larger scales, the measurement of distance is also affected by the 
expansion of the universe
.  In practice, a number of 
distance measures
 are used in 
cosmology
 to quantify such distances.



Other spatial distances
[
edit
]


Manhattan distance
 on a grid


Unusual definitions of distance can be helpful to model certain physical situations, but are also used in theoretical mathematics:



In practice, one is often interested in the travel distance between two points along roads, rather than as the crow flies.  In a 
grid plan
, the travel distance between street corners is given by the 
Manhattan distance
: the number of east–west and north–south blocks one must traverse to get between those two points.


Chessboard distance, formalized as 
Chebyshev distance
, is the minimum number of moves a 
king
 must make on a 
chessboard
 in order to travel between two squares.


Metaphorical distances
[
edit
]


Many abstract notions of distance used in mathematics, science and engineering represent a degree of difference or separation between similar objects.  This page gives a few examples.



Statistical distances
[
edit
]


Main article: 
Statistical distance


In 
statistics
 and 
information geometry
, 
statistical distances
 measure the degree of difference between two 
probability distributions
.  There are many kinds of statistical distances, typically formalized as 
divergences
; these allow a set of probability distributions to be understood as a 
geometrical object
 called a 
statistical manifold
.  The most elementary is the 
squared Euclidean distance
, which is minimized by the 
least squares
 method; this is the most basic 
Bregman divergence
. The most important in 
information theory
 is the 
relative entropy
 (
Kullback–Leibler divergence
), which allows one to analogously study 
maximum likelihood estimation
 geometrically; this is an example of both an 
f
-divergence
 and a Bregman divergence (and in fact the only example which is both). Statistical manifolds corresponding to Bregman divergences are 
flat manifolds
 in the corresponding geometry, allowing an analog of the 
Pythagorean theorem
 (which holds for squared Euclidean distance) to be used for 
linear inverse problems
 in inference by 
optimization theory
.

Other important statistical distances include the 
Mahalanobis distance
 and the 
energy distance
.



Edit distances
[
edit
]


In 
computer science
, an 
edit distance
 or 
string metric
 between two 
strings
 measures how different they are. For example, the words "dog" and "dot", which differ by just one letter, are closer than "dog" and "cat", which have no letters in common.  This idea is used in 
spell checkers
 and in 
coding theory
, and is mathematically formalized in a number of different ways, including 
Levenshtein distance
, 
Hamming distance
, 
Lee distance
, and 
Jaro–Winkler distance
.



Distance in graph theory
[
edit
]


Main article: 
Distance (graph theory)


In a 
graph
, the 
distance
 between two vertices is measured by the length of the shortest 
edge path
 between them.  For example, if the graph represents a 
social network
, then the idea of 
six degrees of separation
 can be interpreted mathematically as saying that the distance between any two vertices is at most six.  Similarly, the 
Erdős number
 and the 
Bacon number
—the number of collaborative relationships away a person is from prolific mathematician 
Paul Erdős
 and actor 
Kevin Bacon
, respectively—are distances in the graphs whose edges represent mathematical or artistic collaborations.



In the social sciences
[
edit
]


In 
psychology
, 
human geography
, and the 
social sciences
, distance is often theorized not as an objective numerical measurement, but as a qualitative description of a subjective experience.
[
4
]
  For example, 
psychological distance
 is "the different ways in which an object might be removed from" the self along dimensions such as "time, space, social distance, and hypotheticality".
[
5
]
  In 
sociology
, 
social distance
 describes the separation between individuals or 
social groups
 in 
society
 along dimensions such as 
social class
, 
race
/
ethnicity
, 
gender
 or 
sexuality
.



Mathematical formalization
[
edit
]


Main article: 
Metric space


Most of the notions of distance between two points or objects described above are examples of the mathematical idea of a 
metric
.  A 
metric
 or 
distance function
 is a 
function
 
d
 which takes pairs of points or objects to 
real numbers
 and satisfies the following rules:



The distance between an object and itself is always zero.


The distance between distinct objects is always positive.


Distance is 
symmetric
: the distance from 
x
 to 
y
 is always the same as the distance from 
y
 to 
x
.


Distance satisfies the 
triangle inequality
: if 
x
, 
y
, and 
z
 are three objects, then 








d


(


x


,


z


)


≤


d

x


,


y


)

Distance between sets
[
edit
]


The distances between these three sets do not satisfy the triangle inequality:








d


(


A


,


B


)


>


d


(


A


,


C


)


+


d


(


C


,


B


)






{\displaystyle d(A,B)>d(A,C)+d(C,B)}






There are multiple ways of measuring the physical distance between objects that 
consist of more than one point
:



One may measure the distance between representative points such as the 
center of mass
; this is used for astronomical distances such as the 
Earth–Moon distance
.


One may measure the distance between the closest points of the two objects; in this sense, the 
altitude
 of an airplane or spacecraft is its distance from the Earth.  The same sense of distance is used in Euclidean geometry to define 
distance from a point to a line
, 
distance from a point to a plane
, or, more generally, 
perpendicular distance
 between 
affine subspaces
.


Even more generally, this idea can be used to define the distance between two 
subsets
 of a metric space.  The distance between sets 
A
 and 
B
 is the 
infimum
 of the distances between any two of their respective points:








d


(


A


,


B


)


=




inf




x


∈


A


,


y


∈


B






d


(


x


,


y


)


.






{\displaystyle d(A,B)=\inf _{x\in A,y\in B}d(x,y).}




 This does not define a metric on the set of such subsets: the distance between overlapping sets is zero, and this distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality for any metric space with two or more points (consider the triple of sets consisting of two distinct singletons and their union).


The 
Hausdorff distance
 between two subsets of a metric space can be thought of as measuring how far they are from perfectly overlapping.  Somewhat more precisely, the Hausdorff distance between 
A
 and 
B
 is either the distance from 
A
 to the farthest point of 
B
, or the distance from 
B
 to the farthest point of 
A
, whichever is larger.  (Here "farthest point" must be interpreted as a supremum.)  The Hausdorff distance defines a metric on the set of 
compact subsets
 of a metric space.

The word 
distance
 is also used for related concepts that are not encompassed by the description "a numerical measurement of how far apart points or objects are".



Distance travelled
[
edit
]


The 
distance travelled
 by an object is the length of a specific path travelled between two points,
[
6
]
 such as the distance walked while navigating a 
maze
.  This can even be a 
closed distance
 along a 
closed curve
 which starts and ends at the same point, such as a ball thrown straight up, or the Earth when it completes one 
orbit
.  This is formalized mathematically as the 
arc length
 of the curve.

The distance travelled may also be 
signed
: a "forward" distance is positive and a "backward" distance is negative.

Circular distance
 is the distance traveled by a point on the circumference of a 
wheel
, which can be useful to consider when designing vehicles or mechanical gears (see also 
odometry
). The circumference of the wheel is 
2π × radius
; if the radius is 1, each revolution of the wheel causes a vehicle to travel 
2π
 radians.



Displacement and directed distance
[
edit
]


Distance along a path compared with displacement.  The Euclidean distance is the length of the displacement vector.


Main article: 
Displacement (vector)


The 
displacement
 in classical physics measures the change in position of an object during an interval of time.  While distance is a 
scalar
 quantity, or a 
magnitude
, displacement is a 
vector
 quantity with both magnitude and 
direction
.  In general, the vector measuring the difference between two locations (the 
relative position
) is sometimes called the 
directed distance
.
[

]
  For example, the directed distance from the 
New York City Main Library
 flag pole to the 
Statue of Liberty
 flag pole has: 



A starting point: library flag pole


An ending point: statue flag pole


A direction: -38°


A distance: 8.72 km


Signed distance
[
edit
]


This section is an excerpt from 
Signed distance function
.
[
edit
]

In 
mathematics
 and its applications, the 
signed distance function
 or signed distance field (SDF) is the 
orthogonal distance
 of a given point 
x
 to the 
boundary
 of a 
set
 Ω in a 
metric space
 (such as the surface of a geometric shape), with the 
sign
 determined by whether or not 
x
 is in the 
interior
 of Ω. The 
function
 has positive values at points 
x
 inside Ω, it decreases in value as 
x
 approaches the boundary of Ω where the signed distance function is zero, and it takes negative values outside of Ω.
[
8
]
 However, the alternative convention is also sometimes taken instead (i.e., negative inside Ω and positive outside).
[
9
]
 The concept also sometimes goes by the name oriented distance function/field.
